It had stood through war, pestilence and more than 1,200 years of whatever the British weather could throw at it. But now a historic tree believed to be the oldest oak in the land has finally been brought crashing down. The Pontfadog Oak was felled by 55mph gales that hit North Wales on Wednesday night. Collapse: Pontfadog Oak tree which has stood since the year 802 after it fell in the early hours of Thursday morning . Debris: The tree fell as wind speed approached 60mph in areas near Chirk, north Wales . Conservationists had repeatedly called for the ancient tree, which had a 42ft girth, to be supported so it could be preserved by future generations. But the \u00a35,700 cost was considered too high, so nothing was done to protect the sessile oak. It had grown at Chirk, near Wrexham, since at least 802AD \u2013 although some claim it may have been 1,600 years old. Welsh Prince Owain Gwynedd rallied his army beneath its branches in 1157, before defeating Henry II at the battle of Crogen. Happier times: The 1,200-year-old tree before it collapsed . Inspection: The Pontfadog Oak collapsed after it was recommended that work should be carried out to preserve it . Legend has it that the tree was spared when Henry had his men cut down the surrounding woods in 1165 and its huge hollow trunk was said to be large enough to seat six people. Woodland Trust conservation adviser Jill Butler said: \u2018This venerable old tree has had a lot to cope with over the past few weeks, with heavy snow, a prolonged cold snap and finally high winds. \u2018But the Woodland Trust believes that this sad case illustrates how we are failing to provide adequate protection for our ancient trees at present.\u2019 Wreckage: Experts said the tree collapse was completely unexpected but comes after it has been battered by both snow and strong winds in recent weeks . Historic: It measured a staggering 12.9metres across and was big enough to sit six people inside its enormous hollow trunk . Damage: The owner of the tree, Diane Coakley-Williams, said that not enough had been done to help preserve it . The winds that hit most of the UK this week have now died down with mild and dry weather forecast for today and tomorrow. The South and South East of England should see some sunshine. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: \u2018We are looking at a pleasant weekend, with temperatures two or three degrees warmer than the seasonal average. \u2018The best of the weather may not come till next Tuesday, when it could hit 18C (64F) in London.\u2019 Spring blooms: Abby Keverne admires the Primroses at the Tregothnan Tea Gardens in Cornwall .

I'm their new nanny: Goat adopts two lambs rejected by their mother . A goat has taken two lambs who were rejected by their mother under her wing. The lambs were born nearly three weeks ago at White Post Farm in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire. When their mother rejected them, Geraldine the Golden Guernsey goat adopted them. When their mother rejected these two lambs, Geraldine the Golden Guernsey goat adopted them . The lambs were born nearly three weeks ago at White Post Farm in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire . The farm has now launched a Facebook page inviting visitors to suggest names for the lambs. Anthony Moore, one of the managers at the farm, said: 'It\u2019s so strange to see her looking after the lambs but the three of them have really bonded and get on really well. 'We were worried at first because the first few days are critical and the lambs need the nutrients from their mother\u2019s milk. Luckily, Geraldine was more than happy to adopt and feed them. 'Now they walk around the farm together and the two lambs never leave Geraldine\u2019s side. They make a really nice little family.' The farm has now launched a Facebook page inviting visitors to suggest names for the lambs . Mr Moore said Geraldine had a male kid earlier this year so is no stranger to motherhood. 'We thought we would try Geraldine when the lambs\u2019 mother rejected them. The Golden Guernsey breed is very friendly and laid back. 'It\u2019s lovely to go in their shed in the morning and see this golden orange-coloured goat with two small black lambs snuggled up by her side. 'Outside, you\u2019ll see them sat on top of Geraldine just as they would their normal mother - it\u2019s a very strange but lovely sight.",

The tiny intricate worlds and shrunken people that make up these latest trend in art are so detailed you can almost picture yourself in them. Using everyday objects like Tupperware boxes, tea cups, thimbles, a footprint in the snow and even\u00a0 finger nails as their canvas, artists from around the world have created unbelievably tiny scenes. From an itsy-bitsy farm in a Tupperware . box to a teeny unlucky crushed man in a snow footprint and a microscopic . family enjoying a picnic on a woman's nails, the patience and skill . needed to make these worlds is incredible. This mini house is hand made out of paper clay and nestled in a garden of real moss and constructed within a thimble . This teeny family enjoy a picnic, on artist Alice Bartlett's nails, which are coated in a grass-like covering . Artist Yuri Yamamoto shows off his skill by transferring part of his miniscule farm scene, complete with farmer, cows, pigs and chickens, to a spoon . There is certainly black humour in this piece as an unlucky mini-man has been crushed by a walking giant . One of the artists Slinkachu has developed an entire project around the concept of tiny scenes set in urban streets. Entitled the 'Little People Project', it has been going since 2006, and the anonymous 32 year-old male artist behind Slinkachu has set up hundreds of scenes around the world. He says of the project: 'One day, while working outside, i started to imagine how much fun it would be hide miniature people in the square around me. 'Over time I have become a lot more . interested in how people react to the images and how people empathised . with the characters and the stories in the photography. 'Each scene involves the remodelling and painting of miniature model train set characters, which I then place, photograph and leave on the street. 'It is both a street art installation project and a photography project. 'The street-based side of my work plays with the notion of surprise and I aim to encourage city-dwellers to be more aware of their surroundings. 'All the figures are stuck down using super glue and are left in situ on the streets. 'Each scene probably takes me a five or six hours in total to complete, from the idea stage to making of the figures, which I individually customise.' A creme brulee serves as the scene of a devastating fire that these mini fireman are dutifully extinguishing in this piece by Minimiam, who uses desserts as a canvas for their art . The great escape gets shrunk down in this scene in which many tiny people are pictured on each others shoulders in an attempt to reach freedom . This tiny beach scene sees mini beach goers enjoying the sand and sea, complete with a tiny umbrella and beach chairs . Other artists like Yuri Yamamoto create a diverse range of art, of which the tiny Tupperware creations are just one aspect. Canadian Nichola Battilana, who runs Pixie Hill Studio, makes a range of thimble worlds under her 'Faery and Pixie' section, aiming to create a mystical world which ignites the imagination. The tiny house is hand sculpted with paperclay and the moss and are natural, and painstaking positioned into the thimble. These tiny climbers brave the mountains of meringues, with one of them tumbling down a sweet but treacherous piste in this piece by Minimian . A paradise made for two... on top of a tennis ball, as the bathing suit clad couple survey the scenery . In a more socially conscious piece, this miniature scene depicts a young boy standing in a mine field, surrounded by danger signs . This miniature pin cushion is small enough to sit in a tea cup and features a tiny house and front garden . You can almost hear the laughter from this tiny playground, where a child is actually posed half way down the slide, while others play play on the swings . Tranquility oozes from this scene where a tiny man sits reading his book atop a stack of normal books . The bird feathers in this smile-inducing scene emphasise the small size of the incredibly detailed models . The imagination goes wild when we glimpse inside this tiny doorway at the side of a fireplace and see a miniscule set of stairs inside sweeping up, in this scene as part of the 'Urban Fairies' project . This shop doorway is adjacent to the tiny, but perfectly match 'fairy' doorway which sits nestled in the side of the shop with a tiny wicket basket by the door .",
        "A Colorado company's recall last week of beef products possibly contaminated with E. coli has been expanded, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said this week. The recall came as a result of \"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states,\" the USDA said. The initial recall of 41,280 pounds announced last Wednesday was voluntarily expanded Sunday to include an additional 380,000 pounds of products made by the JBS Swift Beef Company, of Greeley, Colorado, the USDA said. The recall came as a result of \"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states, of which at least 18 appear to be associated,\" the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a written statement. USDA spokesman Brian Mabry said no fatalities had been reported. On its Web site, the company said the suspect beef was produced at its Greeley plant on April 21 and distributed nationally and internationally. \"Each of our customers will be personally informed of this recall by phone,\" the wholesaler said. A spokesman would not identify those customers to CNN. \"That's ridiculous!\" said Sarah Klein, a staff attorney for the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"JBS should be able to say who they sold meat to, and those companies should be able to say, 'These are the products we created from them.' \" She expressed concern that nearly seven months into the Obama administration, a key undersecretary position at the USDA has not been filled, which may be slowing the government's ability to respond to such health threats. \"That person in that position would have significant public health experience and understand how these processes work, how meat enters the chain of commerce,\" Klein said. The recall underscores the need for \"a comprehensive animal identification system\" that would allow meat suppliers to trace their products to an individual ranch, she said. Klein urged supermarkets that use customer loyalty cards to track shoppers' purchases to determine those who have bought the recalled meat. Boxes of the recalled product bear the establishment number \"EST. 969\" inside the USDA mark of inspection, the identifying package date of \"042109\" and a time stamp ranging from \"0618\" to \"1130,\" the statement said. It added that some of the beef products might have undergone further processing and might not have the \"EST. 969\" marking on products for sale directly to consumers. The USDA urged any customers with concerns to contact the store where they bought the meat. JBS spokesman Chandler Keys said his company's products may have had nothing to do with the outbreak. \"It is important for consumers to note that the recalled product from the date in question was sold by JBS as whole muscle cuts, not as ground beef,\" Keys said on the company's Web site. \"The ground beef that might have been associated with illness was produced by other companies who often do not use the antimicrobial intervention steps we employ in our facility to reduce the risk of the beef products.\" He said JBS agreed to expand its recall \"out of an abundance of caution for consumers.\" Symptoms of infection with E. coli bacteria can include severe or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal cramping. The USDA urged consumers to cook all ground beef or ground beef patties to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit to kill any bacteria. CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report."
